## Hello, world!

This is my new website, that - actually - is not a website.
As i've been using github for a long time and now it converges with - at the most part - everything that i want to do in a near future, it's more than logical to me change my hole digital publications to this platform.

### Why?!

You could be asking yourself. The answer is pretty simple: I can share code directly with you. I mean real code, from real projects. And now you can also collaborate.
