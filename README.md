# Hello, world!

This is my new website, that - actually - is not a website.
As i've been using github for a long time and now it converges with - at the most part - everything that i want to do in a near future, it's more than logical to me change my hole digital publications to this platform.

### Why?!

You could be asking yourself. The answer is pretty simple: I can share code directly with you. I mean real code, from real projects. And now you can also collaborate.

## Game development
Those bellow are the games that i am working on at the moment. Each one can be in a different platform and use different technologies. Feel free to read the code, fork and collaborate if you want.

## Web development
The web development section can have more than websites, believe me. Here you will probably find complex web apps, web apis, maybe some really inteligent and critical systems with friendly innocent web fron-end, but do not underestimate them. I trully believe that some day the web apps will survive  and raise from the mobile apps apocalipse. Or not. Feel free...

## Microsoft Dynamics 365
It's not all about jokes. We all need to pay our bills. Here you and me can find the most reasonable solutions for day-by-day problems when you work with this powerful Microsoft business platform. Of course i'm talking about the beloved Dynamics platform.

## Algorithms
This section only exists to help me keep the brain working, and it's cool. Whenever i see a good algorithm or even a pretty normal one that makes me like or think that it might help me out some day, i'll put it in here. If you think this can help you as well, you know what to do.
