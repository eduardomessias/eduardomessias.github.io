Using Power BI to publish a simple dashboard

---

Power BI is really simple to setup and import data, but there are so many resources in it that, actually, is easy to get lost and end up not knowing what to do with it. This is my case!

There are just a few things that I know about this incredible tool so I decided to learn a little bit more about it.

*Simple Power BI Dashboard built integrated with Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O data-warehouse.*

In Power BI we can use a bunch of types of data-sources, including SQL Server, CSV files, JSON files, Oracle databases, among other.
It's possible to import the whole data-source or even just a *"Direct Query"* (as it's called) that eventually it'll also become a data-set inside the dashboard project in the tool.

I am not so good with the terminology yet, so i'll just update a simple list down here with some *"Data Science"* naming conventions that i'll learn along the way.

 Naming convention | Real meaning 
------------------ | -------------
*Data set*         | The collection of data that is retrieved from a specified data-source. It's actually the data that the data scients will work with.
