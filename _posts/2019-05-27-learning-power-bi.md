How to use Power BI and publish a simple dashboard

---

Power BI is really simple to setup and import data, but there are so many resources in it that, actually, is easy to get lost and end up not knowing what to do with it. This is my case!

There are just a few things that I know about this incredible tool so I decided to learn a little bit more about it.
