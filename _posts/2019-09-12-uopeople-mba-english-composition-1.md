Difference between topic, thesis and introduction
  
A topic can be percpepted as the main theme of the text. For it, one sentence is enough sometimes.

The thesis is the group of sentences that tries to proof something in its content.

The introduction describes the subject of your text and gives to the reader a "map" to the rest of the document. It can take the first paragraph or even the first few pages of your work, dependending on what's it about.
