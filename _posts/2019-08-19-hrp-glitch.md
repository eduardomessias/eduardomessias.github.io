Development environment

**[THERE SHOULD BE A VIDEO IN HERE]**

In order to start the development of any kind of software, it's important to set up your dev environment. And that's what i've done here. I started a trully hard job that is to study not only the best tools the market has to offer, but also in which of them my idea suits better. And the idea is not yet so clear, as you could've seen in my first video. It will be an HRP. Ok. Open-source. Ok. Other than that? I don't know.

So, firstly, i've done some research and realized that there's just a few easy-to-get sites in the internet where people are saying something about this kind of software. In fact, there is only one place where i found some material that shares the same concept that i'm talking about. It's quite old, but the idea is there. [Have a look if you want](https://www.infosysblogs.com/sap/2010/03/hrp_home_resource_planning_an.html). From this article, i could draw some of the basic functionalities that the HRP will have, and from that, i could start imagine its user interface, as a web platform and modular mobile apps.

But then, i changed my mind to a component-based web app. Which is modern and in the future will help the technology to continue to grow up. One framework immediately came to me, and i believe for you too, **NodeJs**, off course. So, i started to look for some robust web app engine to sustain such kind of application. **ExpressJs** was the chosen one. For the database, **MongoDb**, and for its engine, **Mongoose**. Regarding the user interface experience, i decided not to go rocket science, but something more consolidated as well. I'll be using the HTML5 template [**Architecture**](https://dashboardpack.com/theme-details/architectui-html-dashboard-free/) (the free version of it), its engine will be [**pug (or jade - old name of it)**](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html).
