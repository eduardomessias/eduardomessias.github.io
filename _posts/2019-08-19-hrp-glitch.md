Development environment

**[THERE SHOULD BE A VIDEO IN HERE]**

So, in order to start the development of any kind of software, it's important to set up your dev environment. And that's what i've done here. In started a real hard job that is to study not only the best tools the market has to offer, but also in which of them suits my idea better. And the idea is not yet so clear, as you could've seen in my first video. It will be an HRP. Ok. Open-source. Ok. Other than that? I don't know.

So, i've done some research and realized that there's just a few easy-to-get sites in the internet where people are saying something about this kind of software. In fact, there is only one place where i found some material that shares the same concept that i'm talking about. It's quite old, but the idea is there.
