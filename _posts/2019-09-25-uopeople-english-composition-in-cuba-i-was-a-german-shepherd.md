A brief analysis over the chapter one of "In Cuba I was a German Shepherd" by Ana Menéndez

---

The chapter one of "In Cuba I was a German Shepherd" is about Máximo and three other men who play Dominoes in a small square in the old Miami, after the Cuban revolution, in 1961. His jokes during the matches reflect his feelings about Cuba and provoke memories of when his family was trying to settle in Miami.

The author, Ana Menéndez, is from an exiled Cuban family and used to work as a journalist at Miami Herald. She seems to understand the Cubans feelings but still give us a soft perception of distance between the reader and the Cuba that she describes, while there's some comfort feeling when we read about Miami. Like it's not possible to understand completely Máximo's jokes or the hole history without living what the Cubans have lived.

A clear evidence of the author's intention to give us this perspective can be found in the excerpt "He and Carlos were Dominican, not Cuban, and they ate their same foods and played their same games, but Antonio knew they still didn't understand all the layers of hurt in the Cuban's jokes." (Menéndez, 1970, pg. 3).

Is quite a nostalgic reading, but also an interesting narrative. I like the subtlety in her words, like when she writes that one man carried a box of plastic dominoes (Menéndez, 1970), you can see the man that will be introduced in the next sentence before it happens. It's a good reading.
