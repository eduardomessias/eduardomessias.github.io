I've working as a developer for approximately twelve years now. 
In the last eight of them i've been engaged with the Microsoft Dynamics platform.
And that's been given me some really exciting challenges, such as to architect critical systems and integrate mobile devices to ERPs.

My main goal is to learn and share!

### More Information

I like music, a lot. And videogames, TV series and movies.
I read only technical books, but i'd like to read everything, honestly.

I never wanted to be a .NET developer nor a game developer or any other specific kind of developer. 
Just a generic one. A developer. And that's all.
